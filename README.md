## backuptxties

The `bt.py` python script backs up [txti.es](http://txti.es/) urls located in `urls.txt` and reloads them. This python script can be set to run using a cron job to continually backup and reload txti.es urls to prevent them from being purged, as well as to maintain a local copy of any of those urls.
